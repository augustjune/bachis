# Existing solutions
There are some tries of others to solve these problems on the JVM platform. Among the most popular ones are:

+ **Apache.math.genetics** - a package under Apache Software Foundation with basic components of genetic algorithms implementation.

+ **Java Jenetics** - an advanced Genetic Algorithm, Evolutionary Algorithm and Genetic Programming library, respectively, written in modern day Java.

## How one can find a solution?
> Just look for it daah.

Some sources: 

+ **Books and conferences** - you can find here a nice good (maybe a little dry) implementation of specific problem solution with genetic algorithm, which may not be even good for your particular case.

+ **GitHub** - the source of ~~all~~ the majority of open-source implementation of specific genetic algorithms, people saw in above mentioned sources.
