\section{Domain overview}

In artificial intelligence, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions. Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems[citation needed]; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.

Overall the optimization methods can be divided generally into two groups: the gradient methods, that operate on a single potential solution and look for some improvements in its neighborhood, and global optimization techniques – represented here by so called evolutionary methods – that maintain large sets (populations) of potential solutions and apply some recombination and selection operators on them. During the last decades, evolutionary methods have received a considerable attraction and have experienced a rapid development. Main paradigms are: genetic algorithm (binary or real coded), augmented simulated annealing (binary or real coded), evolution strategy and differential evolution. Still, each of these methods has many possible improvements.
In this theses the author is concentrating on subfamily of evolution methods named genetic algorithms. It is one of the most popular representative of evolutionary methods and serves as a great example, because it allows to observe and study the properties of the whole family.

\subsection{How evolutionary algorithms are used nowadays?}

Typically, optimization methods arising in engineering design problems are computationally demanding because they require evaluation of a quite complicated objective function many times for different potential solutions. Moreover, the objective function is often multi-modal, non-smooth or even discontinuous, which means that traditional, gradient-based optimization algorithms fail and global optimization techniques, which generally need even a larger number of function calls, must be employed. Fortunately, the rapid development of computational technologies and hardware components allows us to treat these problems within a reasonable time.

Genetic algorithms have been applied in science, engineering, business and social sciences. Number of scientists has already solved many engineering problems using genetic algorithms. GA concepts can be applied to the engineering problem such as optimization of gas pipeline systems. Another important current area is structure optimization. The main objective in this problem is to minimize the weight of the structure subjected to maximum and minimum stress constrains on each member. GA is also used in medical imaging system. The GA is used to perform image registration as a part of larger digital subtraction angiographies. It can be found that GAs can be used over a wide range of applications \cite{introduction_to_ga}. Genetic algorithms can also be applied to production planning, air traffic problems, automobile, signal processing, communication networks, environmental engineering and so on. There is a lot of examples discussed in \cite{creative_ga} from music, art in general, architecture and engineering design.

\subsection{Disadvantages}
As every other technique, genetic algorithm has its flaws. In this theses the author tries to attract attantion to the two most important disadvantage of genetic algorithms, due to subjective opinion. For each of them is proposed an alternative solution, which will later take place in functional requirements of the thesis work.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Implementation complexity}

There are many problems of different types, which may me optimized by genetic algorithms. The downside is that for each of those problems there is a need of specific implementation, which is at least time consuming. Even though the low level details, which depend on the problem GA is applied to, will change, the high level abstraction of genetic algorithm workflow remains the same: a population of individuals are processed in pipeline of genetic operators, resulting in a new fitter population.

A solution for this problem would be a high level generic representation of genetic algorithm, which may be reusable among variety of application and independent from the low level details. 
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Computation cost}

Genetic algorithms tend to be very time consuming. This is strictly related to its computation model, as the function, used in GA, are usually very demanding.

This characteristic of genetic algorithms, however, may be negated by the usage of parallelization.
\medbreak

\end{enumerate}

\section{Solution proposal}

A solution for described flaws would be a tool, which allows to integrate a high-performance implementation of the genetic algorithm into user application and use it for the arbitrary optimization problem with minimum changes required to the existing codebase. Additionally, this should be a convenient toolbox for theoretical and practical problems which might be resolved using genetic algorithms, providing a ready-made implementation of the most popular algorithms with extra features, which save users from implementing one themselves. For a solution to be considered as fulfilled, it is neccessary to meet both functional and non-functional requirements predifined in advance.

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Java Virtual Machine}

This platform was chosen, because of its popularity and open nature. Java virtual machine is supported by many languages, what allows a user to pick a specific one, which is the best for a given circumstances. JVM is also vastly used and run on over 3 billion devices\footnote{According to official information provided by Oracle Corporation}.
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Open implementation}

The implementation of the tool has to be open to its users, allowing to view and expand source code to the specific needs. 
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Modular architecture}

The architecture solution used to build the tool has contain modularity among its fundamentals. This means, that allowing different features, its components have to be grouped according to their functions, so the users, who are interested in a small part of provided functionality wouldn't be forced to use all capabilities of the tool.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Limiting the evolution in terms of time and/or number of iterations}
This is basic requirement for every genetic algorithm implementation. Evolution process takes time and in order to benefit from it, user must have access to the evolved version of population. Number of iterations corresponds to the number of evolution cycles performed on the population, when every genetic operator is applyed to it. On the other hand, the actual time of the evolution may be changed even in terms of the same number of iterations, as it strongly depends on performance of genetic operators and fitness function, so in some cases time may be the only valid criterion, which decides that evolution process should be stopped. 
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Controll of the best individual through evolution}

During the evolution process, due to the chosen selection, crossover or mutation strategies, even the fittest individual may not end in the next population. As for business needs it is important to get the best solution ever discovered by algorithm, it is important to store reference to that candidate separately.
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Fitness values caching}
In genetic algorithms, the computation of the fitenss function provides the largest computational load for the algorithm. Each population genration is composed of individuals who are formed from previous gneeration via cloning, crossover, or mutation. It is also common for the individual to migrate to the next population without a change or, less common, a crossover of two different individuals may produce a genotype that already has been discovered earlier. If this occurres rather frequently, it is unprofitable to compute the fitness value all over again. As a solution one may consider caching the results of fitness computation for later reusage. Although it noticeably increases the speed of algorithm, the cache tends to grow dramatically, so the coise of data structure for this purposes is extrimely important. 
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Parallel evolution processing}

Genetic algorithms are generally known as a time-consuming technique, as it is often used with complex, high-dimensional problems. Evolution cycle may take up to hours and days of continuous computing, depending on the parameters of the algorithm and hardware in use, which comes with a great cost and very low flexibility, as with every mistake or change was done to algorithm implementation, evolution needs to be re-executed. On the other hand, even small upgrades in speed may result as a major cost cut.

For this reason, it is highly important to use the maximum of the given resources, avoiding unreasonable workloads. It may be achieved through the computation parallelization between multiple virtual CPU cores within a single machine
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Asynchronous evaluation of fitness value}

The solution must allow to compute fitness values on different machine or even cluster of machines, as well as using different low-level programming language or some specific optimization, with no need to switch the entire application to another platform. This type of environment also fits perfectly to cloud computing solutions, as fitness evaluation is entirely isolated from the rest of application.
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Generic representation of individual}

There is a wide set of problems which might be resolved using genetic algorithms. Still, this optimization technique is rarely used in business applications and mainly considered as a theoretical solution. One of the reasons for such phenomenon is the difficulty which comes with a try to use genetic algorithm optimization without a previous plan to do so. The process of reshaping the existing codebase in such way, so typical genetic algorithm could be applying often demands big costs and high level of understanding GA workflow and its possibilities.

Depending on the problem a user is trying to solve, a standard representation of each candidate solution would be an array of bits, integers or real numbers. The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which facilitates simple crossover operations. For the purposes of genetic programming and evolutionary programming tree-like and graph-form representation are used respectively, which causes the necessity in different implementations for each problem.

A solution to this problem is an implementation of the genetic algorithm, which is able to work on generic types, which represents a candidate solution for the applied problem. Due to this property, it is possible to reuse the implementation for different problems and create a generic tool, which is decoupled from the problem it is applied to.
\medbreak

\item \textbf{Evolution in distributed environment}

As already mentioned, parallelization is a big part of speed optimization for genetic algorithms. While local parallelization is usefull and convinient for medium- and small-sized problems, working with complex use cases often demands the resources, which is may not fit into one machine. Distributed environment is a next step of parallelization, when evolution process is split between different machines, each computing its own part of the workload. This approach enables horizontal scaling, when each added machine increases performance of the algorithm.  
\medbreak

\item \textbf{On-demand evolution}

Genetic algorithm optimization is generally used for finding the best solution for a defined problem, which is the fittest candidate to the provided fitness function. It means, that the best solution is defined relative to all the solutions assigned earlier and cannot be proved as the optimal one, even when it is. But when applying to a nontrivial problem, finding the optimal solution is not always cost-effective, as it may take up to exponential time. For this reason, it is common to compute a 'good enough' solution in reasonable time. Depending on the business reasons, this time varies so sometimes it is possible to wait until the better solution is computed and sometimes it is not. For instance, if the application which uses genetic algorithm has a real-time interface and its user is interested in gaining a solution for the particular case in the range of seconds, it is justifiable to provide a solution which may not be optimal but is close to it.

On the other hand, when a user is ready to allow the application to take its time in order to provide a better result, it has to still be possible to resume the evolution. Again the application should not limit users in such important cases, as the end user needs may vary depending on different circumstances, which may not be predicted in advance. The evolution of a solution to a given problem should be available on-demand, without forcing unreasonable resource uses, and adjust to a specific case as much as possible.
