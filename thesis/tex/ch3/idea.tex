\section{Idea}

The main goal of this theses is to create a tool, which allows to integrate a high-performance implementation of the genetic algorithm into user application and use it for the arbitrary optimization problem with minimum changes required to the existing codebase. Additionally, this should be a convenient toolbox for theoretical and practical problems which might be resolved using genetic algorithms, providing a ready-made implementation of the most popular algorithms with extra features, which save users from implementing one themselves.
