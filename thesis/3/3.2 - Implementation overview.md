## Implementation overview

It has the core part of genetic algorithm implementation, which can be shared between different applications. It consist of a pipeline separated by three stages: selection, crossover and mutation, which evolves the population of individuls, increasing average level of adjustment and finding the best individual according to provided fitness function; preimplemented most popular strategies of genetic selection, crossover and mutation, with possibility of providing additional ones for specific reasons and a set of platforms which allow to run the pipeline in a different ways, best suited for existing hardware.
