## Implementation overview

The solution is presented as an open-source library, that provides the major part of genetic algorithm implementation, which can be shared between different application. Base algorithm consist of a pipeline separated by three stages: selection, crossover and mutation, which evolves the population of individuals, increasing average level of adjustment and finding the best individual according to provided fitness function; pre-implemented most popular strategies of genetic selection, crossover and mutation, with possibility of extanding with the additional ones for specific reasons and a set of platforms which allow to run the pipeline in a different ways, best suited for existing hardware. The library is supplied with key features, basing on the concepts described earlier, wrapping all the components into sufficient framework.
