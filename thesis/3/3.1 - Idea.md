## Idea
The solution contains a the set of tools which one can use for applying genetic algorithm for arbitrary problem of parameter tuning. It has the core part of genetic algorithm implementation, which can be shared between different applications. It consist of a pipeline separated by three stages: selection, crossover and mutation, which evolves the population of individuls, increasing average level of adjustment and finding the best individual according to provided fitness function; preimplemented most popular strategies of genetic selection, crossover and mutation, with possibility of providing additional ones for specific reasons and a set of platforms which allow to run the pipeline in a different ways, best suited for existing hardwear.

### Key concepts
The key features which allow the tool be both well rounded and still powerfull for every parameter optimization problem. 

#### Arbitrary representation of individual
This allows to use the algorithm in a simple way with any existing program.
Algorithm works for you, not vice versa
#### Local and distributed parallelization
Allows to speed up the computation time and reasonably use the maximum of provided hardware resources.
#### Large size of the population
Abillity to store the data on disk as well as in memory and performing jobs at the parts of the population
#### Unlimited evolution
On-demand reactive streams
#### Flexible evolution flow
Being able to combine different flows and to start from any population, which may be result of previous evolution.
