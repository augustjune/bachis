## Idea

The main goal of this theses is to create a tool, which allows user to integrate a high-performance implementation of genetic algorithm for the arbitrary problem with minimum changes required to the existing codebase.
> The tool has to be flexible enough to be used with predefined concepts  

It has the core part of genetic algorithm implementation, which can be shared between different applications. It consist of a pipeline separated by three stages: selection, crossover and mutation, which evolves the population of individuls, increasing average level of adjustment and finding the best individual according to provided fitness function; preimplemented most popular strategies of genetic selection, crossover and mutation, with possibility of providing additional ones for specific reasons and a set of platforms which allow to run the pipeline in a different ways, best suited for existing hardware.


### Key concepts
[comment]: # (ToDo - add description)
In order to create a solution which will resolve existing problems of usage of genetic algorithms in business and academia applications

#### Arbitrary representation of individual
There is a wide set of problems which might be resolved using genetic algorithms. Still this optimization technique is rarely used in business applications and mainly considered as theoretical solution. One of the reasons of such phenomenon is the difficulty which comes with a try to use genetic algorithm optimization without previous plan to do so. The process of reshaping the existing codebase in a such way, so typical genetic algorithm could be applying often demands big costs and high level of understanding GA workflow and its possibilities. 

Depending on the problem a user is trying solve, a standard representation of each candidate solution would be an array of bits, integers or real numbers. The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which facilitates simple crossover operations. For the purposes of genetic programming and evolutionary programming tree-like and graph-form representation are used respectively, which couses the necessity in different implementations for each problem.

A solution for this problem is implementation of genetic algorithm, which is able to work on generic types, which represents a candidate solution for applied problem. Due to this property it is possible to reuse the implementation for different problems and create a generic tool, which is decoupled from the problem it is applied to.

#### Local and distributed parallelization
Genetic algorithms are generally known as a time-consuming technique, as it is often used with NP-hard problems. Evolution cycle may take up to hours and days of continuous computing, depending on the parameters of the algorithm and a hardware in use, which comes with a great costs and very low flexibility, as with every mistake or change done to algorithm implementation, evolution needs to be reexecuted. On the other hand, even small upgrades in speed may result as a major cost cut.

For this reason it is highly important to use the maximum of the given resources, avoiding unreasonable workloads. It may be achieved through the computation parallelization between multiple virtual CPU cores within a single machine and distributing computation in a cluster of working nodes. For the better result, two approaches may be combined and used together.

[comment]: # (May be expanded)

#### Large size of the population
The important parameter of genetic algorithm is population size.

Abillity to store the data on disk as well as in memory and performing jobs at the parts of the population

#### On-demand unlimited evolution
On-demand reactive streams

#### Flexible evolution flow
Being able to combine different flows and to start from any population, which may be result of the previous evolution.
