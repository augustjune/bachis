# What is my solution to a given problem?

Here is a small (or not so) presentation of what I propose to do in order to resolve existing issues with applying genetic algorithms.

## Idea
The solution contains a the set of tools which one can use for applying genetic algorithm for arbitrary problem of parameter tuning. It has the core part of genetic algorithm implementation, which can be shared between different applications. It consist of a pipeline separated by three stages: selection, crossover and mutation, which evolves the population of individuls, increasing average level of adjustment and finding the best individual according to provided fitness function; preimplemented most popular strategies of genetic selection, crossover and mutation, with possibility of providing additional ones for specific reasons and a set of platforms which allow to run the pipeline in a different ways, best suited for existing hardwear.

### Key concepts
The key features which allow the tool be both well rounded and still powerfull for every parameter optimization problem. 

#### Arbitrary representation of an individual
#### Local and distributed parallelization
#### Large size of the population
#### Unlimited evolution
#### Flexible evolution flow
