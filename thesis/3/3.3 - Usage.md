#### Evolution Engines
#### Genetic operators
##### Laws
There are predefined mathematical laws which determine if the algorithm you use as one of the genetic operators is going to increase overall population adjustment and come closer to finding best suited individual.
###### Modification
A lawfull modification of type is any function of type `A => A`, where `A` is a type of individual, which holds these properties:

+ A modified instance does not equal to original one (*e.i. modification function does not equal to indentity function*)
```scala
	modify(g) != g
```
+ After a certain number of modification the same input produces different outputs (*modification functions is randomized or depends on outer values*)
```
	def modify5(g: G) = modify(modify(modify(modify(modify(g)))))
	modify5(g) != modify5(g)
```
